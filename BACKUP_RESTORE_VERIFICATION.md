# Backup/Restore Verification for Sales Statistics

## Summary

Sales statistics (`totalSales` and `totalRevenue`) are **already included** in the backup/restore functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Backup Process

When backing up data (Settings page → "Backup Data"):

1. **Data Collection** (`_backupData()` method, line 1886-1889):
   ```dart
   final backupData = {
     'alteredSettings': dataState.settings.toJson(),
     'products': dataState.products.map((p) => p.toJson()).toList(),
   };
   ```

2. **Product.toJson()** method (lines 85-95):
   ```dart
   Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
     'id': id,
     'name': name,
     'smallVariation': smallVariation.toJson(),
     'mediumVariation': mediumVariation.toJson(),
     'largeVariation': largeVariation.toJson(),
     'imageUrl': imageUrl,
     'listingUrl': listingUrl,
     'totalSales': totalSales,        // ✅ Sales count included
     'totalRevenue': totalRevenue,    // ✅ Revenue included
   };
   ```

3. **Result**: JSON file contains sales statistics for each product

### Restore Process

When restoring data (Settings page → "Restore Data"):

1. **Data Parsing** (`_onRestoreData()` method, line 379-385):
   ```dart
   final productsData = data['products'] as List;
   final newProducts = productsData.map((p) => Product.fromJson(p)).toList();
   await productBox.clear();
   for (var product in newProducts) {
     await productBox.put(product.id, product);
   }
   ```

2. **Product.fromJson()** factory (lines 97-107):
   ```dart
   factory Product.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => Product(
     id: json['id'] as String,
     name: json['name'] as String,
     smallVariation: ProductVariation.fromJson(json['smallVariation']),
     mediumVariation: ProductVariation.fromJson(json['mediumVariation']),
     largeVariation: ProductVariation.fromJson(json['largeVariation']),
     imageUrl: json['imageUrl'] as String?,
     listingUrl: json['listingUrl'] as String?,
     totalSales: (json['totalSales'] as num? ?? 0).toInt(),        // ✅ Sales restored
     totalRevenue: (json['totalRevenue'] as num? ?? 0.0).toDouble(), // ✅ Revenue restored
   );
   ```

3. **Result**: Products are restored with their sales statistics intact

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation includes backward compatibility:

- If a backup file doesn't have `totalSales` or `totalRevenue` fields (old backup), they default to `0` and `0.0` respectively
- New backups always include these fields
- This ensures old backups can still be restored without errors

## Example Backup JSON Structure

```json
{
  "alteredSettings": {
    "filamentCostPerKg": 17.5,
    "electricityCostKwh": 0.15,
    ...
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-1234",
      "name": "Elephant Figurine",
      "smallVariation": {...},
      "mediumVariation": {...},
      "largeVariation": {...},
      "imageUrl": "https://...",
      "listingUrl": "https://...",
      "totalSales": 12,           // ✅ Included in backup
      "totalRevenue": 456.0       // ✅ Included in backup
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Verification Steps

To verify sales statistics are properly backed up and restored:

1. **Setup**: Add sales to a product using the (+) button
2. **Backup**: Go to Settings → Data Management → "Backup Data"
3. **Modify**: Change the sales count or revenue for the product
4. **Restore**: Go to Settings → Data Management → "Restore Data" and select the backup file
5. **Verify**: Check that the product's sales count and revenue match the backed-up values

## Conclusion

✅ **Sales statistics are fully supported in backup/restore**

No code changes are needed - the functionality was already implemented in commit 6b8600a when the sales tracking fields were added to the Product model's JSON serialization methods.
